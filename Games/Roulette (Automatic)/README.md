We have a user with an initial amount of money (p.e. 100) and we set a target (p.e. 200).
At the beginning, the user decides the minimum bet (as a percentage of initial money).
After that, they folllow an automatic process of:
* Doubling bets after each loss
* Betting the minimum bet after each win
